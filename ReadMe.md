## Overview

This week dives into web-based backend development using Java. You'll start by understanding the servlet container, then move on to working with Spring Boot to build RESTful services, structure projects using service and repository layers, and integrate with databases.

## Topics Covered

### Day 1: Tomcat Servlet

- Introduction to web servers and servlet containers
- Setting up and deploying a servlet using Apache Tomcat
- `HttpServlet`, `doGet()`, and `doPost()` methods
- Web.xml configuration and basic request handling

### Day 2: Spring Introduction

- Overview of Spring and Spring Boot
- Key features and benefits
- Setting up a Spring Boot project
- Understanding `@SpringBootApplication`, `@RestController`, and `@RequestMapping`

### Day 3: Spring REST API Calls and Request Handling

- Creating RESTful endpoints with Spring
- Handling GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests
- Path variables and request parameters
- Understanding `@RequestBody` and `@ResponseEntity`

### Day 4: Spring Framework and Multi-Layer Development with H2 DB

- Introduction to layered architecture: Controller, Service, Repository
- Using Spring Data JPA
- Integrating H2 in-memory database
- CRUD operations with JPA Repositories

### Day 5: Spring Employee Payroll App Setup with Service Layer & Address Book Application Setup

- Building a basic applications for both
- Setting up DTOs, service classes, and repository interfaces
- Connecting all layers: Controller → Service → Repository
- Testing endpoints with Postman

## How to Use This Repository

This repository includes example projects and practice exercises. You can run the code using Spring Boot and test the APIs with tools like Postman. Modify and expand the applications to reinforce your backend development skills.
